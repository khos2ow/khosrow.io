My name is Khosrow Moossavi, I'm a Cloud Native DevOps and Infrastructure Developer with extensive experience of Java. Recently I started
coding with Golang. I'm in love with automation, as a wise man once said *"Automate all the things!"*, on that note, on a daily basis, I
use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/),
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) to name a few. Currently I'm working @ [CloudOps](https://www.cloudops.com/),
maintaining and implementing infrastructure of [cloud.ca](https://cloud.ca/).

I'm a huge fan of Open Source and advocate it all the times, and try to contribute back as much as my time and knowledge allows. I am currently
a semi-fulltime contributor to [Apache CloudStack](https://cloudstack.apache.org/) (Open Source Cloud Computing™) project, one of the maintainers
of [Open Source Cities](https://github.com/opensourcecities), specifically [Montréal](https://opensourcecities.github.io/montreal/) and also a
contributor to [Hugo Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) (the base theme of this site!).

I use Containers, well who doesn't! I have a strong knowledge of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ecosystem, including Compose, Swarm and good working knowledge of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
[ecosystem](https://landscape.cncf.io/). I'm soon to be [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/cka/) (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) and [CKAD](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/cka/ckad/)
(Certified Kubernetes Application Developer).

On my spare time you can find me in a [bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) gym or if the weather is good,
somewhere outdoor on the rock. I'm in love with [buildering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buildering) also known as "Urban Bouldering"
([#sendthiscity](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sendthiscity?lang=en)).

If you want to hire me, need a consultation or simply want to hang out and chat, feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:me@khosrow.io) or
[ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/khos2ow).

Thanks for reading!
