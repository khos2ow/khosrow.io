My name is Khosrow Moossavi, I'm a senior Java and Cloud Infrastructure Developer and DevOps engineer. Currently I'm
working @ [CloudOps](https://www.cloudops.com/), maintaining and implementing ifrastructure of [cloud.ca](https://cloud.ca/).

I am a contributor to [Apache CloudStack](https://cloudstack.apache.org/) (Open Source Cloud Computing™) project, and one of the
maintainers of [Open Source Cities](https://github.com/opensourcecities), specifically [Montréal](https://opensourcecities.github.io/montreal/).

I'm soon to be [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/cka/) (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) and [CKAD](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/cka/ckad/)
(Certified Kubernetes Application Developer).

On my spare time you can find me in a [bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) gym or if the weather is good,
somewhere outdoor on the rock. I'm in love with [buildering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buildering) also known as "Urban Bouldering"
([#sendthiscity](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sendthiscity?lang=en)).

If you want to hire me, need a consultation or simply want to hang out and chat, feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:me@khosrow.io) or [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/khos2ow).

Thanks for reading!
